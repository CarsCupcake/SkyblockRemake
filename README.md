<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Here you will learn the most important steps how to use the Skyblock Remake system on your server.

### Prerequisites

Skyblock Remake depends on the following systems. 
They must be installed in any case before the start!

<h3>FAWE - WorldEdit</h3>
Spigot Resource: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fastasyncworldedit.13932/

<h3>Lib's Disguises</h3>
Spigot Resource: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/libs-disguises-free.81/

<h3>ProtocolLib</h3>
Spigot Resource: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/

<h3>PlugMan</h3>
Bukkit Resource: https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/plugman
_Plugman is only optional! It simplifies reloading plugins and 
prevents errors when loading SkyblockRemake._

### Installation

_Here you will learn briefly and concisely how to install and set up SkyblockRemake correctly._

1. Download the plugin from the official [GitHub Page](https://github.com/CarsCupcake/SkyblockRemake/releases). [(LINK COMING SOON)]
2. Put the downloaded .jar file into the plugins folder of your server.
3. Reload your server with /reload.
4. _Check if there is an error in the console._
5. In your plugins folder, the "SkyblockRemake" folder should now have been created.

_In this folder there are even more new files and folders._
_The file named "config.yml" is the center of your system
and manages the most important settings._
_There you can customize everything as it is most convenient for you._

<h3>Important</h3>
Make sure you change the value **`ServerType`** in the config.yml to the type you want to use.

<h3>Optional</h3>
If you want you may also download the following worlds.
Just replace the default "world" folder in your server folder
with the world you'd like to use.

_It is also possible to use Multiverse if you want to use
multiple worlds at once._

**Worlds:** https://www.mediafire.com/folder/bfouoag1ij261/Skyblock+Worlds
